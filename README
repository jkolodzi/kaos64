# kaos64
Korg(R) KAOSS Pad(R) like instrument for Commodore 64 
(version 0.01)
Best used with a Commodore 64 and Koala Pad (or similar); VICE can emulate it with the mouse capture option.
Up/Down = filter frequency, right/left = oscillator frequency
Prototype alpha version. TODOs (almost everything!):
* waveform change
* filter change
* scales
* convert to 6502 machine code
